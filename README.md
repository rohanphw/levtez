# LevTez

Simplifies the process of obtaining **long leverage on $XTZ**, using the [Kolibri](https://kolibri.finance) protocol.

## What is leverage?

Leverage simply refers to using borrowed funds to amplify your financial takes.

If you believed $XTZ is going to go up in price, how would you be able to take advantage of this conviction other than just buying $XTZ with your money?
Borrowing more money and buying $XTZ with the borrowed money(/leverage). This is a common strategy applied throughout the history of financial systems.

## What is Kolibri?

Kolibri is a stable-coin system that lets you put up $XTZ as collateral, and borrow a stable-coin, $kUSD against it.

## How does it work?

LevTez takes advantage of batch transactions and simplifies the whole process of obtaining leverage.
The individual steps to obtain leverage through Kolibri would look like this -

1. Deposit $XTZ on Kolibri.
2. Borrow $kUSD on Kolibri.
3. Swap the borrowed $kUSD to $XTZ on Quipuswap(or your DEX of preference).
4. Deposit the swapped $XTZ back on Kolibri.

LevTez does all of the above for the user, in one-click.
